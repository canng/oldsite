The dissetation entiled <b>"Assessment of Climate Change and Urbanization Impacts on Urban Surface Temperature and Ecosystem Services of Urban Green Spaces"</b>, which in turn addressed 3 specific objectives: 

* To detect the integrated impacts of urban expansion and climate change on urban surface temperature and surface urban heat island over the past thirty years in primary SEA cities.

* To analyze cooling effects generated by urban parks as a typical category of urban green spaces.

* To assess ecosystem services delivered by public parks to urban dwellers using a non-monetary approach through stakeholdersâ€™ perception analysis.
