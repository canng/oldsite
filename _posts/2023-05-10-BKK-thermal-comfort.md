This year, 2023, we are facing the extremely hot entire Thailand. 
The new record in terms of the highest temperature has been set.

Our study used remote sensing based indices and auxiliary data from both physical and non-physical features to depict outdoor thermal comfort in the BMA. 

The specific figures related to impervious ratio, building density, building height, vegetation and water surfaces, etc. were proposed as the considered standards for urban planning to minimize outdoor thermal discomfort.
