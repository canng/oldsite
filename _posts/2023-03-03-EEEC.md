#### Ecological Environment Changes in Eastern Economic Corridor
##### Monitoring and Assessing Ecological Environment Changes from 2013 to 2021


The “Eastern Economic Corridor” (EEC) covers three eastern provinces of Thailand (i.e., Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Rayong) to revitalize Eastern Seaboard Development Program established in the 1980s, not extended after the first phase.
With intensive investments in export-oriented products, logistics and infrastructure projects, and heavy industry, the development has significantly deteriorated eco-environment in EEC. 

<i> Our research revealed that: </i>

* Dynamic eco-environment in EEC over the past decade with poor environment located along the coastal city chain. It tends to be deteriorated significantly. 
* Eco-environment dynamics are controlled by a group of static and dynamic elements, in which land use change, infrastructures, and climatic elements are the most important factors.
