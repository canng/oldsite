<b>"Assessment of Climate Change and Urbanization Impacts on Urban Surface Temperature and Ecosystem Services of Urban Green Spaces"</b>, which in turn addressed 3 specific objectives: 

* To detect the integrated impacts of urban expansion and climate change on urban surface temperature and surface urban heat island over the past thirty years in primary Southeast Asian cities (i.e., Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh city, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Mainila, Yangon).

* To analyze cooling effects generated by urban parks as a typical category of urban green spaces using InVEST-Urban Cooling Model.

* To assess ecosystem services delivered by public parks to urban dwellers using a non-monetary approach through stakeholdersâ€™ perception analysis.
