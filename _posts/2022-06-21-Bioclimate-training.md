# [TRAINING] BIOCLIMATIC ARCHITECTURE: PRINCIPLE AND BEST PRACTICES


<i> The objective of this training is to provide Vietnamese actors with a bioclimatic design method to apply in new construction projects to lower operating energy and improve thermal comfort. This training is designed based on the learning from the 2 pilot projects supported by ADEME in the framework of collaboration with the Ministry of Construction of Vietnam.  </i>

* It is expected that after the completion of the training, the trainees would:

* Have a good understanding of the importance of taking into consideration the principles of bioclimatic architecture right from the start of the building design process itself

* Gain knowledge on how the adoption of natural ventilation principles can help to make the best use of the local climate in ensuring thermal comfort with minimal need for energy, irrespective of whether the building is air-conditioned or not

* Be familiar with the French initiative to provide a line of credit to finance Vietnamese property developers with energy-efficient and thermal comfort building projects, and to facilitate access to credit for middle-income housing with concessional rates.

* After completing the training program, learners will have the chance to receive the certificate provided by the organizers.
