## Urban Heat Island Research: Progress, current issues, and perspectives

Rising importance of Urban Heat Island (UHI) research, driven by concerns about heat stress in urban areas amid urbanization and climate change. While remote sensing has advanced understanding, persistent issues in Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) studies, such as varied definitions of urban areas and cloud cover methodologies, lead to uncertainties. We highlight these challenges, proposes future research directions, and evaluates the past decade's SUHI studies, emphasizing control factors, proxies, impacts, and mitigation interventions. 

#### Highlights

<li> An overview of global urban heat island intensity studies is given. </li>

<li> We review and synthesize the controlling factors and quantities in urban heat island assessments. </li>

<li> Impacts of urban heat islands from perspective of urban air pollution and public health, and the mitigation strategies are discussed. </li>

<li> We highlight common issues and uncertainties in urban heat island research along with future research directions. </li>
