## Highlights
<fieldset>
  <ul>
  <li>Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City were investigated for urbanization and climate change.</li>
  <li>Temperature extremes, urban expansion, and surface urban heat island were compared.</li>
  <li>Nocturnal warming was significantly observed from 1990 to 2020.</li>
  <li>Urbanization shifts landscape metrics and aggravates urban heat island.</li>

## Abstract
<fieldset>
  This study assessed the combined influences of climate change and urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) in the Bangkok metropolitan region (BKK) and Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area (HCM) during 1990–2020. We found climate change evidence from trends and variations of temperature extremes in both cities throughout the past three decades, especially for the significant upward trends of nighttime temperature in HCM (0.23 – 0.3 °C/decade). These cities have been undergoing rapid urbanization, in which HCM has a higher urbanization rate with an annual growth rate of 8.03%/year against BKK (4.26%/year). Landscape metrics have rapidly shifted towards urban aggregation and green space fragmentation along with urbanization. A peer comparison shows that BKK holds a greater urban size and LST intensity, while HCM leads in urban growth and SUHI magnitude. These changes jointly contribute to climbing SUHI intensity, especially the dramatic influence of surface changes. Yet, temperature extremes also play an indispensable role in regulating SUHI magnitude, in which the impact in HCM is considerable compared to the effect in BKK. The research findings provide crucial information for both cities – where incorporation of climate change resilience strategies and SUHI mitigation into the master plans for livable cities are recommended. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670722002050?via%3Dihub"> View full-text </a>
